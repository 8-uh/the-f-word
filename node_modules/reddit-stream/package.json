  "readme": "#reddit-stream\n\n## About\n\nreddit-stream is a NodeJS module that provides a constant stream of posts and comments from reddit. This module uses [rereddit](https://github.com/chuckpreslar/rereddit) to retrieve data from reddit.\n\n## Usage\n\nInstall via NPM.\n\n```bash\n$ npm install reddit-stream\n```\n\nThen simply require within your application, start the bot, and subscribe to the \"new\" event:\n\n```coffee\nRedditStream = require 'reddit-stream'\n\ncomment_stream = new RedditStream 'comments', 'all', 'unique user agent for my-supercool-bot'\n\n# optionally log in\ncomment_stream.login('my-supercool-bot', 'password').then(\n  ->\n    console.log 'logged in for comment stream'\n    comment_stream.start()\n  ->\n    console.log 'failed to log in!'\n)\n\ncomment_stream.on 'new', (comments) ->\n  console.log 'found', comments.length, 'comment(s)'\n```\n\n## RedditStream Parameters\n\nThe RedditStream class's constructor accepts three parameters:\n\n1. `type` - the type of item to stream from reddit; either \"comments\" or \"posts\"\n2. `subreddit` - (optional) the subreddit to read items from; default is \"all\"\n3. `user_agent` - (optional) reddit suggests supplying a unique user agent for all bots; default is \"reddit-stream bot\"\n4. `user` - (optional) a [rereddit](https://github.com/chuckpreslar/rereddit) user object if you've already logged in outside of this module\n\n## License\n\n> The MIT License (MIT)\n\n> Copyright (c) 2014 Colin Wood\n\n> Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\n> of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\n> in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\n> to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\n> copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\n> furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\n> The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\n> all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\n> THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\n> IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\n> FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
